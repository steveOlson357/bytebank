This folder has the zipped 'Sidescroll' game. The game was created by me using Gamemaker Studio around 2014 on Windows 7. The game still works on Windows 11! 
Simply download the zip and extract all before running the executable to open the game in its own window

Move with the arrow keys
Jump with Space
Pause with Enter
Reset with Delete
Exit the game with Escape

Object: Get the ninja to contact the message block to advance (first level is the "Start Game" message block)

The yellow squares offer a power up to increase speed and jump height for a short time.

Enjoy!
